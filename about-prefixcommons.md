PrefixCommons is a cross cutting effort started by members of the Monarch Initiative and BD2K

It integrates available information about various web identifier schemes in the life-sciences, with the aim of making this information machine actionable and human searchable by anyone for any reason.

Other great platforms exist for resolution and registration of prefixes. We are aiming to harmonize, not compete with them.
a) reduce likelihood of single prefix being registered to two different datasources. b) reduce likelihood of a single datasources being registered under two different prefixes.

A very light weight demonstrator of the integrated prefix metadata corpus is here: http://prefixcommons.org More information and code to follow.
