It would be good to collect evidence of identifier pain. The purpose of this list could be used to 
* Convince funders of the problem
* Provide a set of references for a paper or specification
* See what can be done to improve informatics/tooling around identifiers

* underscore delimited forms
* case sensitivity

* institutional code collisions

* number of shortform and http URI permutations found in the wild for a single identifier in NCBI gene

* Identifier mapping issues

* Prefix heterogeneity OMIM vs MIM. Have to build special processors to collapse them.

* TAIR prefix variation difficult to resolve
